# Echoes in the Dark

Welcome to **Echoes in the Dark** ‚Äî a modern, modular roguelike engine and game demo built in OCaml. This project is all about learning, experimentation, and pushing the boundaries of functional game development.

---

## üöÄ What is Echoes in the Dark?

- **Turn-based, entity-driven roguelike** with a focus on extensibility and clarity.
- **Entity-Component System (ECS):** All game objects are entities with flexible, composable components.
- **Infinite/Procedural World:** Powered by a dynamic chunking system for seamless exploration.
- **Modern OCaml:** Uses the [Base](https://github.com/janestreet/base) library, functional patterns, and Raylib bindings for graphics/input/audio.
- **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation of UI, core logic, resources, and utilities.

## üß© Architecture & Docs

- **[System Architecture](docs/architecture.md):** High-level overview, major modules, and how everything fits together.
- **[Project Structure](docs/project_structure.md):** Directory/module breakdown, dependency diagrams, and data flow.
- **[Chunking System](docs/chunking_design.md):** How the world is split into 32x32 chunks for infinite/procedural generation.
- **[Workflow & Coding Policies](docs/workflow_policies.md):** How we work, code, and contribute (OCaml functional style, memory files, reviews, etc.).
- **[Story & Lore](docs/story_line.md):** The narrative, world, and monster/item lists.

## Performance Optimization Features

To help optimize performance in this roguelike game, the following features have been implemented:

### 1. Packed Array Components

The traditional ECS implementation using hashtables has been enhanced with a packed array alternative that can be used for performance-critical operations:

- The `Components.Packed_components` module provides efficient array-based storage for hot components
- Components implemented with packed arrays include: Position, Stats, Blocking, and Renderable
- This provides better data locality and cache efficiency compared to hashtables
- The packed representation supports batch operations for processing multiple entities efficiently

### 2. Performance Profiling

The game includes a built-in performance profiling system that can be enabled with the `--profile` command-line flag:

```
./echoes_dark --profile
```

When enabled, this will:
- Track component access patterns and timing
- Generate periodic performance reports showing hotspots
- Enable the use of optimized data structures for performance-critical operations

### Using the Profiler in Development

To add profiling to a new component:

1. Update the `performance_profiler.ml` module to track the new component type
2. Create wrapper functions that time component access
3. Update systems to use packed components for batch operations where appropriate

### Performance Optimization Guidelines

For future development, consider these optimization guidelines:

1. Use packed arrays for components that are frequently accessed
2. Implement batch operations for processing multiple entities at once
3. Keep hot data together for better cache locality
4. Use the profiler to identify bottlenecks before optimizing
5. Consider spatial partitioning for collision and visibility tests
6. Minimize dynamic memory allocation during the game loop

The performance tools make it easy to measure the impact of optimizations and ensure the game runs smoothly even with many entities.
