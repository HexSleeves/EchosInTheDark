## Storyline & Backstory

### The Setting

  The mining town, let's call it Rockfall, was once prosperous, built around the discovery of rich veins of ore deep below. Generations ago, miners delved deeper than ever before, seeking even greater riches.

### The Incident

  They broke into a vast, unnatural cavern system far below the normal veins. There, they disturbed something ancient – perhaps a slumbering subterranean entity, a sealed portal, or the source of a magical corruption. This unleashed monstrous creatures and a creeping blight that slowly began to poison the lower mines and affect the townsfolk above (perhaps causing sickness, madness, or strange mutations).

### The Task

  The player character (you can decide if they are an outsider drawn by rumors, a native returning home, or someone with amnesia found near the town) awakens in Rockfall. The town is a shadow of its former self, isolated and desperate. The remaining elder, or perhaps the last sane member of the mining guild, tasks the player with descending into the Stoneheart Depths (the name given to the corrupted lower mines) to retrieve a specific artifact – maybe the "Heartstone" (a large, powerful gem whose removal caused the disaster, or perhaps an artifact needed to seal the breach/cure the blight), rescue a vital person lost in the depths, or simply find the source of the corruption and destroy it to save Rockfall. The initial "something" they are told to retrieve could be relatively simple (like special tools or a map fragment from a slightly deeper level), leading them further down into the main plot.

### The Goal

  The player must retrieve a specific artifact – maybe the "Heartstone" (a large, powerful gem whose removal caused the disaster, or perhaps an artifact needed to seal the breach/cure the blight), rescue a vital person lost in the depths, or simply find the source of the corruption and destroy it to save Rockfall. The initial "something" they are told to retrieve could be relatively simple (like special tools or a map fragment from a slightly deeper level), leading them further down into the main plot.
