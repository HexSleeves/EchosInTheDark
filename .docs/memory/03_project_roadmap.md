## In Progress

- [ ] Combat system implementation
- [ ] Inventory and item management
- [ ] Amulet/final level logic
- [ ] Game win/lose conditions

## Future Plans

### Short Term

1. Gameplay Enhancements
   - Additional entity behaviors
   - More complex interactions
   - Enhanced UI features
   - Item pickup and usage
   - Combat mechanics

2. Technical Improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Code cleanup and refactoring
   - Documentation updates
   - Additional tests

### Long Term

1. Feature Additions
   - Advanced game mechanics (magic, skills)
   - More sophisticated AI for creatures
   - Enhanced visual effects
   - Sound effects and music
   - Save/load functionality

2. System Improvements
   - Scalability enhancements
   - Additional tooling
   - Performance optimization
   - More complex dungeon generation algorithms

## Known Issues

- Some action types (Interact, Pickup, Drop, Attack) are defined but not fully implemented
- Need to implement proper game win/lose conditions
- Need to add more creature types and behaviors
- UI could be enhanced with more information and better visuals

## Version History

- Initial implementation with basic entity system and map generation
- Added multi-level dungeon support with level transitions
- Implemented level state persistence for backtracking
