## Build Verification

- Always run `dune build` to confirm new modules and changes compile without errors and satisfy the build system.

## Map Generation & Stairs

- Use BFS to place stairs as far apart as possible, with randomness for replayability.
- Always update graphical support when adding new tile types (e.g., stairs).
- Store stairs positions in map data for easy multi-level transitions.
- Player spawn logic should be flexible for both first and subsequent levels.
