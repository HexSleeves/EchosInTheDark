## Recent Fixes & Patterns

- Added stairs (up/down) to map and rendering logic; ensure all new tile types are handled in both logic and UI to avoid missing glyphs or errors.
- BFS-based farthest-point stair placement avoids trivial/boring layouts.
- Multi-level groundwork: always store stairs positions for correct player placement on transitions.
