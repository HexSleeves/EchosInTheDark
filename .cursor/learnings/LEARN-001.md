**Learning ID**: LEARN-001
**Created**: 2023-08-02
**Keywords**: OCaml, Roguelike, Functional Programming, Game Development

## Overview

This learning document explores the advantages, challenges, and patterns for developing roguelike games in OCaml, a statically-typed functional programming language.

## Advantages of OCaml for Roguelikes

1. **Strong Type System**
   - Prevents many common bugs through compile-time checks
   - Pattern matching ensures exhaustive handling of variants
   - Makes refactoring and maintenance safer

2. **Immutable-by-default Data Structures**
   - Natural fit for game state that changes discretely between turns
   - Easier to reason about state changes
   - Simplifies implementing features like game history and undo

3. **Pattern Matching**
   - Elegant handling of different entity types and game situations
   - Concise code for complex conditional logic
   - Compiler ensures all cases are handled

4. **Module System**
   - Helps organize code into logical components
   - Interfaces (signatures) provide clear boundaries
   - Functors allow parameterized components

5. **Performance**
   - OCaml compiler produces efficient native code
   - Garbage collector well-suited for games with discrete turns
   - Optimized operations on immutable data structures

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **State Management**
   - **Challenge**: Functional programming emphasizes immutability
   - **Solution**: Use a central state record that's passed through update functions

2. **Mutable Game Elements**
   - **Challenge**: Some elements like map tiles need efficient updates
   - **Solution**: Use arrays or mutable record fields where appropriate

3. **Graphics Integration**
   - **Challenge**: Limited graphics libraries specifically for OCaml
   - **Solution**: Raylib bindings provide sufficient functionality

4. **Game Loop**
   - **Challenge**: Implementing a responsive game loop in functional style
   - **Solution**: Separate pure logic functions from effect-producing loop

## Implementation Patterns

1. **Central State Record**

   ```ocaml
   type t = {
     seed : int;
     map : Tilemap.t;
     entities : Entity.t list;
     mode : CtrlMode.t;
     random : Rng.State.t;
   }
   ```

2. **State Update Functions**

   ```ocaml
   let update_state state action =
     match action with
     | Move dir -> { state with player_pos = move_player state.player_pos dir }
     | Attack target -> { state with entities = update_entities state.entities target }
     ...
   ```

3. **Pattern Matching for Actions**

   ```ocaml
   match input with
   | Key.Up -> Move North
   | Key.Down -> Move South
   | Key.Space when has_enemy_at player_pos -> Attack (enemy_at player_pos)
   | _ -> NoAction
   ```

4. **Modules for Components**

   ```ocaml
   module Tilemap = struct
     type t = { ... }
     let generate ~seed ~width ~height = ...
     let get_tile map x y = ...
   end
   ```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Immutability Benefits**
   - Game history becomes trivial to implement
   - Debugging is easier with immutable state changes
   - Concurrency is simplified

2. **Type-Driven Development**
   - Define types first, then implement functions
   - Let the compiler guide implementation
   - Makes refactoring safer and easier

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Use arrays for grid-based data
   - Consider mutable fields for frequently updated values
   - Profile critical sections and optimize as needed

4. **Balance of Functional and Imperative**
   - Pure functions for game logic
   - Controlled mutability for performance
   - IO and effects at the edges of the system

## Future Exploration

- Entity component systems in OCaml
- Persistent data structures for game state
- Functors for algorithm parameterization
- Integration with GUI frameworks for better interfaces
